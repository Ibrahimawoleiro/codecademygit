        <tr>
          <td>Class Selectors</td>
          <td>Selects an element by class.<br>
To select an HTML element by its class using CSS, a period (.) must be prepended to the class’s name. In the example above, the class is brand, so the CSS selector for it is .brand.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            ID Selectors
          </td>
          <td>
        Selects based on id of an element
<h1 id='large-title'> ... </h1>
In contrast to class which accepts multiple values, and can be used broadly throughout an HTML document, an element’s id can only have a single value, and only be used once per page.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Universal Selector</td>
          <td>You learned how the type selector selects all elements of a given type. Well, the universal selector selects all elements of any type.
Targeting all of the elements on the page has a few specific use cases, such as resetting default browser styling, or selecting all children of a parent element. Don’t worry if you don’t understand the use cases right now—we will get to them later on in our Learn CSS journey.
The universal selector uses the * character in the same place where you specified the type selector in a ruleset, like so:
* { 
  font-family: Verdana;
}
In the code above, every text element on the page will have its font changed to Verdana.</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
          pseudo-class
          </td>
          <td>
            You may have observed how the appearance of certain elements can change, or be in a different state, after certain user interactions. For instance:
* 		When you click on an input element, and a blue border is added showing that it is in focus.
* 		When you click on a blue <a> link to visit to another page, but when you return the link’s text is purple.
* 		When you’re filling out a form and the submit button is grayed out and disabled. But when all of the fields have been filled out, the button has color showing that it’s active.
These are all examples of pseudo-class selectors in action! In fact, :focus, :visited, :disabled, and :active are all pseudo-classes. Factors such as user interaction, site navigation, and position in the document tree can all give elements a different state with pseudo-class.
A pseudo-class can be attached to any selector. It is always written as a colon : followed by a name. For example p:hover.
p:hover {
  background-color: lime;
}
In the above code, whenever the mouse hovers over a paragraph element, that paragraph will have a lime-colored background.
